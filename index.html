    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <div>
      Hi, I'm <span class="text-1">AHMAD WAHAB</span>, a 3rd-semester Computer Science student at UET Lahore. I’m passionate about blending creativity with technology and constantly seeking new ways to expand my knowledge and skills. I had the honor of being the only ALPHA MLSA (Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador) in my batch, a position that helped me grow both personally and professionally by allowing me to engage with a global network of learners and professionals.
<br>
I am proficient in <span class="text-1">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span>, and am currently exploring React to advance my front-end development skills. One of my notable projects includes building a professional website for an industry, showcasing their work and enhancing my development expertise.
<br>
Apart from coding, I am deeply passionate about <span class="text-1"> photography</span>, specializing in portrait photography and cinematic storytelling. Photography is not just a hobby but a major skill that I’ve honed over time. I share my creative work on <a href=""><span class="text-1"><strong>Instagram</strong></span></a>, where I strive to tell compelling visual stories.
<br><br>
